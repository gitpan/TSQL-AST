__DATA__


=head1 SYNOPSIS

Parses Microsoft's Transact SQL dialect of SQL.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This only provides a very 'broad brush' parse of TSQL.  
It aims to be accurate in what it does parse, but not to provide any great detail.
Currently it recursively recognises the major block structure elements of TSQL.

This is still *ALPHA* quality software.  It should still be a developer-only release, but I'm getting tired of those.
If you've come looking for a full-blown TSQL parser, you're going to leave here very disappointed.
Even when finished, this is going to leave most of your SQL unparsed.  
It's intended to support another piece of work, which is currently only in the planning stage, and will have its
development driven from those requirements as they materialise.

Note TSQL::AST is only intended to parse syntactically valid TSQL.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 C<new>

=over 4

=item * C<< TSQL::AST->new() >>

=back

It creates and returns a new TSQL::AST object. 

=head2 C<parse>

=over 4

=item * C<< $ast->parse( array of sqlfragments ) >>

This is the method which parses the split up SQL code from the original script.

    my $sql_splitter = TSQL::SplitStatement->new();
    
    my @statements = $sql_splitter->splitSQL( 'SELECT 1;SELECT 2;' );

    my $sql_parser = TSQL::AST->new();
    
    my $ast = $sql_parser->parse( \@statements );
    
=back    

=head2 C<script>

=over 4

=item * C<< $ast->script() >>

This is the method which retrieves the AST for the script just parsed.

    my $sql_splitter = TSQL::SplitStatement->new();
    
    my @statements = $sql_splitter->splitSQL( 'SELECT 1;SELECT 2;' );

    my $sql_parser = TSQL::AST->new();
    
    my $ast = $sql_parser->parse( \@statements );

    my $script = $ast->script();
    
=back    

=head1 LIMITATIONS

No limitations are currently known, as far as the intended usage is concerned.  
You *are* bound to uncover a large number of problems.

Please report any problematic cases.
